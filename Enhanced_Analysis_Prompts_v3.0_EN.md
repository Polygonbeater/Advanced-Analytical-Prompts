### 11. BONUS: Meta-Prompt for Comprehensive Strategic Analysis

**Prompt**: *Act as an external strategic advisor to the Board of Directors. Your task is to prepare a comprehensive strategic analysis for [company/product] to enter [new market]. Follow these steps:*

1.  **Macro-environmental Analysis (PESTLE):** Start with a PESTLE analysis of the target market to understand the Political, Economic, Social, Technological (including the impact of AI), Legal, and Environmental (ESG) factors. Summarize the key opportunities and threats arising from the external environment.
