# Advanced Analytical Prompts for Strategic Thinking (V3.0)

This repository contains a curated set of expert-level analytical prompts designed for use with advanced AI models like GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, and others. These prompts provide structured frameworks for deep analysis in business strategy, risk management, innovation, and decision-making.

This collection evolved through a collaborative process, starting from a robust base ("The Star Ten") and progressively adding layers of sophistication based on expert feedback, resulting in this comprehensive Version 3.0.

## What's Inside?

This package includes 11 detailed prompts based on established analytical methodologies:

1.  **Taleb's Methodology:** For risk analysis and building robust systems.
2.  **SWOT Analysis:** For strategic planning and option selection.
3.  **Cynefin Framework:** For decision-making in complex environments.
4.  **OODA Loop:** For rapid decision-making in competitive environments.

8.  **5 Whys (Root Cause Analysis):** For deep problem-solving.
9.  **Design Thinking:** For user-centric innovation.
10. **Scenario Planning:** For navigating extreme uncertainty.
11. **BONUS: The Meta-Prompt:** A comprehensive workflow combining PESTLE, Porter's Five Forces, and SWOT for a complete strategic analysis.

Each prompt is designed to be a complete toolkit, including steps for data validation, analysis, pre-mortem reviews, cognitive bias checks, and the formulation of actionable strategies with advanced metrics (KPIs and KBIs).
